  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This brief text explores the meaning of the word &ldquo;Gospel&rdquo;. We start by showing how this word was used in the first century, then explore its meaning in the New Testament, and close by making some remarks about its misuse.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h2>
<p>The word &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; from the Greek &ldquo;εὐαγγέλιον&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;good news&rdquo;. In Jesus&rsquo; time, this word was commonly known. The gospel was the message that the emperor brought peace (i.e. conquered militarily) to some land. Of course that wasn&rsquo;t good news for the conquered people, such as the Jews.</p>
<p><img src="202309101225_Calendar_Inscription_of_Priene.bmp" alt="Calendar Inscription of Priene"></p>
<p>But those who read the Hebrew Bible in Greek (a translation known as the Septuagint) knew another reference of the word &ldquo;εὐαγγέλιον&rdquo;: the book of Isaiah. In Isaiah 52:7 we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How beautiful upon the mountains
are the feet of the messenger who announces peace,
who brings good news,
who announces salvation,
who says to Zion, “Your God reigns.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and in the beginning of Isaiah 61, which is the text that Jesus reads in the synagogue in Luke 4:16-30,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spirit of the Lord God is upon me
because the Lord has anointed me;
he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed,
to bind up the brokenhearted,
to proclaim liberty to the captives
and release to the prisoners,
to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the gospel in Isaiah is the message that &ldquo;the Creator is, at last, taking his power and reigning, and putting things right. That is what it means to talk about the kingdom of God&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji0XgjPumVI">N.T. Wright</a>).</p>
<h2 id="the-gospel-in-the-new-testament">The Gospel in the New Testament</h2>
<p>However, most of us have heard that the gospel is the message that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all sinners, but Jesus died in our place, so we get to go to heaven if we believe in him&rdquo;. But this, as N.T. Wright says, is a misreading of Romans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a misreading, more particularly, of the beginning of Romans, because in Romans 1 verses three and four, Paul actually gives his definition of the gospel, and his definition of the gospel isn&rsquo;t about a mechanism whereby we can get saved, it is about the reality that Jesus, the Son of God, the descendant of the seed of David according to the flesh has now having been crucified, been designated Son of God in power according to the spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead and he is now the Lord of the world and he summons all people everywhere to live under his lordship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having clarified the definition of the Gospel, let us consider two fundamental themes of the New Testament that help us grasp its meaning.</p>
<h3 id="cosmic-restoration-apokatastasis">Cosmic Restoration (Apokatastasis)</h3>
<p><img src="202309101430_The_Harrowing_of_Hell.bmp" alt="The Harrowing of Hell"></p>
<p>One of the most beautiful passages of the New Testament, which helps us grasp the meaning of the Gospel is Ephesians 1:9-10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God has made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ, as a plan for the fullness of time, to gather up all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, we see that the Gospel is the message that, in Christ, God was reconciling with himself everything. In Greek, &ldquo;ανακεφαλαιωσασθαι τα παντα εν τω χριστω&rdquo;. This long word, &ldquo;Anakephalaiosastai&rdquo;, means to gather up, to sum up. And God is gathering under Christ &ldquo;τα παντα&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;everything&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In Acts 3:21 we meet another Greek word related to this: &ldquo;Apokatastasis&rdquo;. The expression here is &ldquo;αποκαταστασεως παντων&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;universal restoration&rdquo; (as the NRSV puts it), the restitution of all things.</p>
<p>The obvious must be clearly stated. &ldquo;All things&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;some things&rdquo;. God is not reconciling with himself only some human beings, or even only human beings, but the whole creation. The same radical &ldquo;πᾶς&rdquo; appears in both Ephesians and Acts and also shows in 1 Corinthians 15:22: &ldquo;for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ&rdquo; and 1 Timothy 4:10: &ldquo;we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="deification-apotheosis">Deification (Apotheosis)</h3>
<p><img src="202309101434_The_Ladder_of_Divine_Ascent.bmp" alt="The Ladder of Divine Ascent"></p>
<p>Another important theme in the Gospel is deification, which is often referred to by the Church Fathers as &ldquo;theosis&rdquo;. In 1 John 4:16, for example, it is written &ldquo;those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in 2 Peter 1:4 we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus he has given us, through these things, his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust and may become <em>participants of the divine nature</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Saint Irenaeus wrote (Against Heresies III.19.1),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For it was for this end that the Word of God was made man, and He who was the Son of God became the Son of man, that man, having been taken into the Word, and receiving the adoption, might become the son of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, in the famous quote from Saint Athanasius&rsquo; treatise &ldquo;On Incarnation&rdquo;, &ldquo;God became man that man might become God&rdquo;. The phrase is popular in the writings of the Church Fathers, also appearing in St. Gregory of Nyssa, St. Maximus the Confessor, St. Augustine, and many others.</p>
<p>The idea, of course, is not to deny the ontological difference between God and humanity, but to point out that the Gospel is not something to only reason about, a logical proposition with which we must agree, but a mystical reality that we must enter in silence and contemplation.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-gospel-is-not">What the Gospel is not</h2>
<p>Having the full perspective that the Gospel is about cosmic reconciliation and a mystical union with God, it becomes clear that the &ldquo;Gospel is not conditional upon our acceptance of it&rdquo;. As Wyatt Houtz (<a href="http://postbarthian.com/2017/04/21/dear-d-l-moody-apostles-didnt-ask-anyone-accept-gospel-regards-karl-barth/">The Apostles Didn’t Ask Anyone to Accept the Gospel</a>) wrote, commenting on Karl Barth&rsquo;s critique of D.L. Moody,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Apostles did not ask anyone to accept the Gospel, because the Gospel didn&rsquo;t depend on anyone accepting it. The Apostles proclaimed the Gospel, whether people accepted it or not! So Barth rejected Moody&rsquo;s Revivalism, because it changed the Gospel from proclamation of the good news of Jesus Christ, into a conditional limited time offer, that one must accept right now, before it is too late!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we follow the Apostles, the Church&rsquo;s presentation of the Gospel should not be a personal invitation, like a marketing campaign, but the proclamation of the new reality (see 1 Corinthians 12:3, Romans 10:9-13, Philippians 2:11).</p>
<p>Furthermore, as <a href="https://postbarthian.com/2017/04/26/jurgen-moltmann-accept-jesus-savior-diminishes-gospel/">Jürgen Moltmann</a> said, &ldquo;&lsquo;I accept Jesus as my savior&rsquo; diminishes the Gospel into an introverted and self-centered individualism.&rdquo; Under this formula, which does not appear anywhere in the Bible, &ldquo;the gospel becomes indistinguishable from atheism because it makes the individual the ultimately determiner of their own destiny.&rdquo; (<a href="https://postbarthian.com/2019/02/12/you-will-not-be-saved-unless-you-make-your-own-personal-decision-for-jesus-christ-as-savior-is-a-false-gospel-t-f-torrance/">Wyatt Houtz</a>)</p>
<p>In fact, this is a heresy known as semi-Pelagianism and is a misunderstanding of &ldquo;Justification by Faith Alone&rdquo;. Notice that the text that inspires the doctrine of justification by faith, Romans 5, is not about individual faith. The Greek word here is &ldquo;πιστεως&rdquo;, from &ldquo;Pistis&rdquo;. It does not mean belief, as I believe in the proposition &ldquo;one plus one equals two&rdquo;, but something completely different: <em>pistis</em> means faithfulness and trust. Thus, it is not our belief that saves us, it is Christ&rsquo;s faithfulness that redeems us. As Paul explains in verse nine, we are &ldquo;justified by his blood&rdquo;, and &ldquo;saved <em>through</em> him&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Going back to N.T. Wright,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gospel isn&rsquo;t just a message about something which might happen to us, it is a new reality, born through Jesus, energized through his Spirit, catching us up within it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we saw, the biblical definition of the Gospel is very different from the contemporary individualistic one, which says &ldquo;You have to believe so you go to heaven&rdquo;. The latter has reduced a cosmic message to an individualistic one and a mystical reality to the realm of facts.</p>
<p>As Karl Barth wrote in &ldquo;The Epistle to the Romans&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gospel is not a truth among other truths. Rather, it sets a question-mark against all truths. The Gospel is not the door but the hinge. The man who apprehends its meaning is removed from all strife, because he is engaged in a strife with the whole, even with existence itself.</p>
</blockquote>
