# Mystical Dogmatics

Goal: Integrate spirituality, dogma, Bible, and liturgy into a cohesive theology. Be creedal, sacramental, ecumenical. Its writing shall reflect as much prayer as studying.

Why write another Dogmatics? This is an attempt to reunite mystical experiences and the dogmas they generated centuries ago. This can be said to be the task of every church dogmatics: to actualize the mystery of the dogma.

And somehow I think this task is also of fundamental importance for apologetics. To convince anybody of the truth of the Christian faith, we must know how to convey its mysteries in a contemporary language.
